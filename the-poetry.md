- good soup
  - but it's like, good
    - it's not the best
      - but who hates soup?
        - why you hate soup?
          - what has the soup ever done to you in its life
            - why would you let soup bring out the radical emotion of hate from you?
          - soup shouldn't have that much control over you
        - soup's your friend
      - love your good soup
    - it's not the best
  - but it's like, good
- good soup

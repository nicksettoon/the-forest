## The Day

- He wakes.  
  - The breaths cost.  
- He works.  
  - The thoughts cost.  
- He climbs.  
  - The efforts cost.  
- He sings.  
  - The noises cost.  

## The Night

- He reaps.  
  - The foods cost.  
- He risks.  
  - The risks cost.  
- He sleeps.  
  - The sheets cost.  
- Repeat.  

## Everything Else

- He never sees tomorrow.
  - He never wins the bet.
- He spends and spends and spends.
  - He has not filed for Chapter 7 bankrupcy yet.

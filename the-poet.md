# the-poet

He wakes.
The breaths cost.

He works.
The thoughts cost.

He climbs.
The efforts cost.

He sings.
The noises cost.

He reaps.
The foods cost.

He risks.
The risks cost.

He sleeps.
The sheets cost.

Repeat.

He never sees tomorrow.
He never wins the bet.
He spends and spends and spends.
He has not filed for Chapter 7 bankrupcy yet.

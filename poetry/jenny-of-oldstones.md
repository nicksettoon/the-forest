# jenny-of-oldstones

_from Game of Thrones Season 8 - Episode 2_

High in the halls of the Kings who are gone  
Jenny would dance with her ghosts  
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found  
And the ones who had loved her the most  

The ones who'd been gone for so very long  
She couldn't remember their names  
They spun her around on the damp old stones  
Spun away all her sorrow and pain  

And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave.  
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave.  

They danced through the day  
and into the nights through the snow that sweapt through the hall.  
From Winter to Summer and Winter again  
Til the walls did crumble and fall.  

At the end of the end  
when the days grew slow and the silence had stunted her step  
She shattered aground with no one around  
Never again to forget  

She never wanted to leave.  
No she never wanted to leave.  
But now the ghosts are free.  
And now so is she.

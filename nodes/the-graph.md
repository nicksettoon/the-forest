# the-graph

_An infinite set of connections (larger in size than you can imagine) which serves as a record of all causes and effects that could possibly occur between all possible particles. Also, the number of particles is larger than you can imagine and the sizes of those particles are smaller than you can imagine._

#t/cbl

Possibly a [hypergraph](https://medium.com/syncedreview/stephen-wolfram-the-path-to-a-fundamental-theory-of-physics-may-begin-with-a-hypergraph-c1fd124b6e62), though who knows what kind of datastructure.

I simply use this to refer to the datastructure containing all possible information.

All information about the [[energy-cannon]].

Every single piece of data about every fluctuation of energy from all possible pasts, presents, and futures.

That dataset which is wholely unfathomably encompassing in size.

That graph which contains within it EVERYTHING.

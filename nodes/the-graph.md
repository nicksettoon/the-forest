Possibly a [hypergraph](https://medium.com/syncedreview/stephen-wolfram-the-path-to-a-fundamental-theory-of-physics-may-begin-with-a-hypergraph-c1fd124b6e62), though who knows what kind of datastructure.

I simply use this to refer to the datastructure containing all possible information.

All information about the [[energy-cannon]].

Every single piece of data about every fluctuation of energy from all possible pasts, presents, and futures.

That dataset which is wholely unfathomably encompassing in size.

That graph which contains within it EVERYTHING.

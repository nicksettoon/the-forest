# why-is-he-in-the-forest

He travels to the forest for various [reasons](what-is-a-reason.md). But the main one is to think. To be alone with himself, or those with which he wishes to be alone. Few (when compared to the thousands he could chose from) join him in the retreat. He brings them to the forest, also for various reasons. But the main one, is to share.
Sharing is an constant action for the man; never removed entirely from his repertoire, only dialed to lower settings. He wishes to always be expelling information into [[the-graph]].

# the-ocean

_the part of [[the-graph]] containing pasts, presents, and futures in which you would not be content_

## The weight

When born, you are tossed into the ocean immediately.  
Some people float, some people sink ([witches](https://youtu.be/zrzMhU_4m-g)).

## The depths

There is also a much larger and more daunting set of timelines which you could never reach due to any one of the following reasons:

1. you're not located at the place in the graph where they are occuring
2. you're not made of the particles that those timelines are happening to.

This seems pretty obvious. You're not those particles so you're not experiencing what they are experiencing.
I'm merely trying to reinforce the sheer size of the darkness below.

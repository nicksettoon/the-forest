## The weight

When born, you are tossed into the ocean immediately.

- There is also a much larger set of timelines which you could never reach due to the fact that you're not made of the particles that those timelines are happening to.  
  - These are timelines you never could have experienced.  
  - Timelines which you made choices that seered you away from them.
  - Timelines which others took from you with their choices. (taking isn't always bad)
- This seems pretty obvious. "You're not those particles so you're not experiencing what they are experiencing."  
- I'm merely trying to reinforce the sheer size of the darkness below.

# The Good Stuff (Prime Sauce (Rare Steak (Choice Meat (aka lil juicy (aka nirvana (aka bird up!))))))

###   Surround yourself with good people

> People are your armor, money is your weapon. Not a perfect analogy, but one I like. Why would you surround yourself with anything less than those you hold in S-tier.

### Do stuff immediately ([[Run]])

> see [[Run]]

### No really do stuff immediately

> what are you doing? should be stuff right now.

### Do it right now

> stop reading go do stuff with your life.

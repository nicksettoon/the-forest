## 3| The Good Stuff (Prime Sauce (Gold Dust (Choice Meat (aka lil juicy (aka nirvana (aka bird up!))))))

### Do stuff immediately

> [[Run]]
>
> No, really, do stuff immediately
>
> What are you doing? Should be stuff right now.
>
> Do it right now.
>
> Stop reading. Go do stuff with your life.

### Assume everything is infinitely more complicated than you think

### Think about all that stuff that your future self will have to do, but won't want to do

> Why don't you just do it for them so they don't have to do it?
>
> Don't you like your future self more than your current self?

### Surround yourself with good people

> People are your armor, money is your weapon. Not a perfect analogy, but one I like. Why would you surround yourself with anything less than those you hold in S-tier.

### Trancendental numbers are holes in the numberline

### Maybe not care so much about failure

> care a little, but manage the care budget so you can care about the stuff that isn't failure

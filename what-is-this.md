## 1| This is a knowledge graph

- Something I'm calling a "digital garden".
  - I think my friend was the first person who said those words to me.
  - There's a decent chance people have already been creating these things and I just don't know about them.

- It's a little tiny collection of "nodes", also called "pages".
  - In each page, headers establish sections.
  - The section headers define a sort of "boundary" between the ideas within the page.

- These are meant to be very specific in their scope.
  - They are focused collections of ideas, which relate to one another through their links, and focus on a specific topic or theme.
  - Occasionally they'll reference things outside the garden on [[THE-INTERNET]]
    - those links will look like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8)
- Each page acts as a concept.
  - Really the creation of a page is just a signifier.
  - It shows that the creator of the graph has deemed it worthy of it's own dedicated line of thinking.
  - It creats emphasis.
  - It is the result of intent.

## 2| What can you do on a page?

There are a collection of objects that format the text in different ways.
The big bones are the 6 header sizes you can use here.

I can nest other objects underneath these headers in various ways as you will see below.

This is what the headers look like all together:

# Header #1
## Header #2
### Header #3
#### Header #4
##### Header #5
###### Header #6

# Header #1 ([All Might](https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Toshinori_Yagi))

  Hi, I'm a sentence and aren't I beautiful?

## Header #2 (I handle major points on the page)

*[if yer not first yer last.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6YsAlYr5AU)*

    Don't talk to that bitch, Becky, in header 1, for I, Dame Codeblock am more beautiful due to my indention on the page and distinct in my ability to contain code in a different font.

### Header 3 (sub-topic land)

- they just don't get it
  - these kids
- understandable
- not being a list
  - it's hard

#### Header #4 (I talk about sub-sub-topics. Super niche.)

  1. Please forgive the swine up in header 3.
  2. He is an unordered list.  
    1. The most vile of the lot.  
      1. He's slightly ordered, but not really.
      2. He lives under a mask of order, convincing others he is "normal", but underneath, he is but pure [chaos](journal/energy-demon.md)
  3. You could rearrange his items easily.
  4. I however, am ordered.  
    1. I bring peace to the chaos  
    2. I have within me, structure
      1. meaning
      2. purpose
      3. intent

##### Header #5 (I'm just a supporting point or something that requires some explanation idk.)

  Yeah! Header 5 is the best! Header 5 or die!

  > Settle down there, young one.
  > "True greatness need not speak, it is spoken of." - [[idk]]
  > (I look like a block and I quote things. Call me Lord Blockquote.)

###### Header #6 ([I like tortles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y))

  *[hi. I'm paul.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fx6eCGsXMw)*

  **hi. he's paul. ^**

  ***PAUL IS BUT A FIGMENT OF YOUR IMAGINATION. HIS LIFE DEPENDS ON YOU KEEPING YOUR FOCUS ON HIS EXISTENCE. DON'T FORGET ABOUT PAUL.***

## 3| Page Disection

  *please don't name the page, you'll get too attached to it.*

- I've altered the group of plants I arranged in the garden above, removing the content and focusing mainly on describing the skeleton.
  - This is just a collection of different objects.
  - The objects themselves don't contain any information but:
    - their identifier (node x.x.x.x)
    - their type (header, sentence, etc...)
  - These are the pieces of information a computer pays attention to in order to discern importance or meaning.
    - Lord Blockquote probably contains a quote.
    - Header 1 is prolly one of the main ideas of the page
  - If the creator of this garden, specifically paid attention to that structure when writing their ideas, [what would they be capable of?](the-system.md)

## 4|  A Boquet of Words

- These objects, nested in a graph like structure, provide a common canvas on which to organize ideas.
- Mainly because it is the same structure as the universe.
- This is just another form of social media.
  - A way of socially sharing media.
  - One where you place ideas in their place the way you see them and share them with others.
  - Every social media platform is just a different way for people to organize ideas.
    - Playlists on Youtube and Tiktok
    - Albums on Instagram
    - Posts and threads on Reddit
    - Hashtags on Twitter
    - Stories on Snapchat
    - Servers on Discord
    - Articles on news websites
    - Menus on restaurant websites
    - They are all just graphs of nodes, linked together just like this.
      - The user interface of the app obscures your view of the datastructure in order to make it easier for you to browse.
- This is a system for deliberate thought; sharing the way you see things, directly from the system you use to take notes.
- Building and sharing these gardens is an exercise I'm sure hundreds of thousands of people could benefit from.

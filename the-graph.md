# the-graph

#t/cbl

Possibly a hypergraph, though who knows what kind of datastructure. I simply use this to refer to the datastructure containin all possible information about the energy that is the universe that could exist, in all possible pasts, presents, and futures.

That dataset which is wholely unfathomably encompassing in size.

That graph which contains within it EVERYTHING.
